## What is Hacktoberfest?  

* Hacktoberfest is a month-long challenge. It happens every year in the month of October.  
*  Hacktoberfest is open to everyone and it marks the celebration of Open Source. Itâ€™s the biggest Open Source event that encourages newbies to participate in Open Source and create their 1st meaningful PR.  


### What is open source? 
* Open source refers to source code that is publicly accessible and allows anyone to inspect, modify or learn from it. Open source projects encourage collaboration and the freedom to use the software for any purpose you wish.


### What is a pull request? 
* Pull requests are proposed code changes you can submit to a branch in a repository on GitHub/GitLab. Once submitted, a project maintainer will review and discuss the changes before they become final. 


### How do I track my progress?
* Log in with your GitHub or GitLab account at [Hactoberfest 2022](https://hacktoberfest.com/)  
* And [click here](https://hacktoberfest.com/profile/) to visit your profile and check your progress and stats.


### How do I get schwags?
* Schwags includes T-shirt and hactober stickers, once you completed the requirements to earn a prize.  


### How is DigitalOcean helping the environment? 
* To limit our carbon impact, we are paying for carbon offsets. And to further help the environment, we're offering the option to plant a tree rather than receive a shirt.
> Fun fact: Hacktoberfest shirts flew 336 million miles internationally last year. In total, it adds up to a fully loaded 747 flying 676 miles.
